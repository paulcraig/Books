Summary:
In The Infinite Game,  Simon Sinek compares finite games, that have a set endpoint, fixed players and the goal to win, with infinite games, which are in many ways loosely defined, the players come and go and the goal is to stay in the game. As I listened to the book, I thought that we might want to consider higher education as an infinite game.

Sinek gives five required essentials of an infinite game (taken from a Wikipedia summary; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game)
Advance a Just Cause
Build Trusting Teams
Study their Worthy Rivals
Prepare for Existential Flexibility
Demonstrate the Courage to Lead

More details on a just cause:

According to Simon Sinek a just cause must have five characteristics:
For something - affirmative and optimistic
Inclusive - open to all those who would like to contribute
Service oriented - for the primary benefit of others
Resilient - able to endure political, technological and cultural change
Idealistic - big, bold and ultimately unachievable

Let's compare RIT's mission statement with these 5 criteria.

Build Trusting Teams
  the importance of emotional intelligence in working together and in deciding about future hires
  the need to deep integrity in our relationships and actions

Study their Worthy Rivals
  how important it is to measure ourselves against our rivals with humility
  rivals still work toward a common goal

Prepare for Existential Flexibility
  the sad story of Kodak, the inventor of the digital camera
  the sad story of Xerox, the inventor of the graphical user interface
  the need to shift our approach according to our just cause

Demonstrate the Courage to Lead
  the impact of long-term (risky) vs short-term (safe) thinking
  the challenges that lie ahead

Discussion questions
Is education an infinite game?

What is RITâ€™s just cause? When RIT began the focus was on providing a trained workforce for Xerox, Kodak, and Bausch and Lomb. What is our just cause now? Do we simply want to survive or do we want to change the nature of education?

Is RIT at a crossroads right now? Are there decisions we need to make particularly in response to COVID-19 to shape the future of our campus?

What choices do we have right now?
